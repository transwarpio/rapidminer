9.10 Jurisdiction.  The parties agree that the jurisdiction and venue of any action with respect to this Agreement shall be in a court of competent subject matter jurisdiction located in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and each of the parties hereby agrees to submit itself to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts for the purpose of any such action.
9.11 Equitable Relief.  The covenants of Licensee in Section 2 and Section 4 hereof are of a special and unique character, and Licensee acknowledges that money damages alone will not reasonably or adequately compensate RapidMiner for any breach of such covenants.  Therefore, RapidMiner and Licensee expressly agree that in the event of the breach or threatened breach of any such covenants, in addition to other rights or remedies which RapidMiner may have, at law, in equity, or otherwise, RapidMiner shall be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief compelling specific performance of, and other compliance with, the terms of such Sections. 
9.12 Force Majeure.  RapidMiner shall not be liable for any delay or failure in performance hereunder caused by reason of any occurrence or contingency beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to, acts of God, war, riot, civil disturbance, acts of any civil or military authority, judicial action, terrorist act, fire, flood, earthquake, strike, delays in transportation, unavailability or shortages of labor, materials or equipment, failure or delays in delivery of vendors and suppliers, interruption or failure of telecommunication or digital transmission links, Internet disruptions, common carrier interruptions, breakdown in facilities, power failure or other accidents or unforeseen circumstances.
