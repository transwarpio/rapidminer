# rapidminer
We are contributing our changes to rapidminer code base including several main improvements.

There are three sub projects inside:
1. rapidMiner: it's the main project which contains all the application code.
2. api-driver: it's a interface layer, so that people can implement different apis which can connect to various back-end services with different protocols.
3. transwarp-midas-api: it's a dummy implementation for reference, and people can provide detailed impl here.
